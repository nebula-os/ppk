# Non-goals
As this package manager is only meant to be used in the most basic of scenarios (as an initial package manager for building Nebula OS) there are some things which are completely out of the scope of this project for the time being.

* Code sandboxing/jailing
* Advanced script-based manifests
* Expendability, modularity
* Repositories
* Multiple shell support
